This project aims to analyse emotions in a block of text and also generate a graph for the ease of interpretation.

### How to Use
Place the text you want to analyze in a file named read.txt.

Ensure that emotions.txt is in the same directory as the program.

Run the program "main-nltk.py"

The program will output the list of emotions and their frequencies, as well as the overall sentiment of the text.

The bar chart of the frequency of each emotion will be saved as report.png.

Note that the nltk library needs to be installed in order for this program to work. You can install it using pip by running pip install nltk in your terminal.

Feel free to modify the program to suit your needs :)
